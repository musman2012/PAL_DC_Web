## Proof of Concept Implementation for LMC1

This website was created for initial proof of concept and currently needs the JSON files to be added manually. An extension can be written using AWS SDK for JavaScript that can fetch the data directly from S3 and process it further. 

Visualizations used in the website that can be used later are:
- A Pie-Chart of aggregated batch data
- HTML table populated from the batches data showing quick overview of each batch
- A time series graph plot of batch is displayed when a batch is clicked in the table
